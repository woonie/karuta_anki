# Karuta Flashcards
I originally wrote this simple web app back in 2013. I had just joined Waseda University for a year-long exchange. Having watched Chihayafuru earlier in the year, I joined the university's karuta club and soon found memorizing the 100 *kimari-ji*s was no mean feat. 

At that time, I was also just starting to learn web programming, so I decided to learn Javascript from scratch and create this flashcard app to help me with memorizing the *kimari-ji* for the game.

# Instructions
All 100 cards are included by default when the page is initially loaded. 

To filter the card list, check the checkboxes of the corresponding first syllable of the *kimari-ji* of the cards you want to practise with, and click on the 'reset' button.

Click on the 'reveal answer' button to see the *kimari-ji* of the current displayed card, 

Click on the 'next card' button to go to the next card. 

Click on the 'previous card' button to go to the previous displayed card.

When you reach the last card of your selected list of cards, you will see the message 'end of card list'. You can either 
* review the cards you've seen by clicking on the 'previous card' button,
* randomize the card order by clicking on the 'reset' button without changing the checked checkboxes, or
* choose a different set of cards to display by changing the checked checkboxes, then click on the 'reset button'. 

# Custom List
You can customize the list of cards you want to practise with by using this feature. 

Click on the 'add current card' button to add the currently displayed card to the custom list. 

Click on the 'remove current card' button to remove the currently displayed card from the custom list.

Click on 'show/hide list' to toggle the display of the current custom list.
