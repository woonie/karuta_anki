# Karuta Flashcards
I originally wrote this simple web app back in 2013. I had just joined Waseda University for a year-long exchange. Having watched Chihayafuru earlier in the year, I joined the university's karuta club and soon found memorizing the 100 *kimari-ji*s was no mean feat. 

At that time, I was also just starting to learn web programming, so I decided to learn Javascript from scratch and create this flashcard app to help me with memorizing the *kimari-ji* for the game.
